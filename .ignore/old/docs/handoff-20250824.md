# Handoff Documentation - 2025-08-24

## Summary of Changes

This handoff documents the recent fixes and improvements made to the Anime File Organizer system, focusing on version conflict resolution and filename cleanup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Comma Removal in Filenames
**File:** `AnimeOrganizer\Modules\AnimeOrganizer.FileParser.psm1`
**Function:** `Get-SafeFileName`

**Problem:** Filenames containing commas followed by dots created grammatically incorrect patterns like `example,.name`.

**Solution:** Added comma removal to the safe filename processing:
```powershell
$safeFileName = $safeFileName -replace ',', ''
```

**Before:** `Please.Put.Them.On,.Takamine-san.S01E07.Even.That.Which.Isn't.Visible.From.There.mkv`
**After:** `Please.Put.Them.On.Takamine-san.S01E07.Even.That.Which.Isn't.Visible.From.There.mkv`

### 2. Smart Version Conflict Resolution
**File:** `AnimeOrganizer\Modules\AnimeOrganizer.FileOperations.psm1`
**Function:** `Execute-FileOperations`

**Problem:** Versioning system broke after refactoring - files weren't getting proper version suffixes when conflicts occurred during execution.

**Root Cause:** The system was trying to rename files to targets that already existed, causing conflicts that were simply skipped instead of being resolved with proper versioning.

**Solution:** Implemented smart conflict detection that:
1. Only applies versioning to duplicate episodes (same episode key like S01E11)
2. Scans the target directory to find existing versions
3. Calculates the next available version number
4. Uses proper regex pattern for version insertion

**Key Code Changes:**
```powershell
# Episode key detection
$sourceEpisodeKey = if ($operation.NewFileName -match '(S\d{2}E\d{2})') { $Matches[1] }

# Version scanning logic
Get-ChildItem -Path $targetDir -Filter "*$sourceEpisodeKey*" | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.Name -match '\.v(\d+)\.') {
        $existingVersions += [int]$Matches[1]
    } elseif ($_.Name -match "$sourceEpisodeKey[^v]") {
        $existingVersions += 1  # No suffix = version 1
    }
}

# Version insertion with corrected regex
$newTargetName = $operation.NewFileName -replace '(S\d{2}E\d{2})\.', "`$1.v$nextVersion."
```

### 3. Test Files Organization
**Action:** Moved test files from root directory to proper test location

**Files Moved:**
- `test-comprehensive.ps1`
- `test-final.ps1` 
- `test-regex-simple.ps1`
- `test-regex.ps1`

**New Location:** `AnimeOrganizer\Tests\`

## Technical Details

### Version Conflict Resolution Logic
1. **Detection:** Only triggers when source and target episode keys match exactly
2. **Scanning:** Examines target directory for all files with the same episode key
3. **Version Calculation:** Finds maximum existing version and increments by 1
4. **Insertion:** Places version number immediately after episode number (S01E11.v2.title.mkv)

### Regex Pattern Fix
**Before (incorrect):** `(S\d{2}E\d{2})(\.)([^\.]+\.\w+)$` - caused double dots
**After (correct):** `(S\d{2}E\d{2})\.` - clean version insertion

## Testing

All functionality has been verified with comprehensive tests:
- Comma removal works correctly
- Version conflict resolution properly detects duplicate episodes
- Version numbering increments correctly (v2, v3, etc.)
- Only applies versioning to actual episode duplicates, not general file conflicts

## Files Modified

1. `AnimeOrganizer\Modules\AnimeOrganizer.FileParser.psm1` - Comma removal
2. `AnimeOrganizer\Modules\AnimeOrganizer.FileOperations.psm1` - Version conflict resolution
3. Moved test files to proper directory structure

## Status

✅ All changes implemented and tested
✅ Versioning system now works correctly
✅ Filenames no longer contain grammatically incorrect comma-dot patterns
✅ Test files properly organized
